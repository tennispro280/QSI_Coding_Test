# CSI Coding Exercise

This goal of this exercise is to give us insight into your coding process.  It's designed to hopefully take no more 
than a couple of hours.

## Instructions

Two CSVs are provided.  *buildings.csv* contains the locations of the 30 tallest buildings in Portland, from Wikipedia.
*queries.csv* contains a set of locations around Portland that were chosen at random.  All dimensions are in feet.

Write a Python program that reads *buildings.csv* and *queries.csv*.  For each location in *queries*, output the name of 
the building point that is closest in 2D.

You may use any version of Python and any freely-available libraries you wish, but please provide an instructional
document detailing how to set up and run the program.

## Bonus tasks

Although it's not required, feel free to add whatever additional functionality you wish.  Some ideas:

- Return additional information about the closest building
- Return all buildings within a user-specified distance from the query location, ordered from tallest to shortest
- Give the option to calculate distances in 3D
- Plot the heights of the buildings
